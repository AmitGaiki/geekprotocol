Geek Protocol is a crowd sourced website that tries to document the protocol for any and all social situations so that you can get the desired output with minimal stress and confusion.

Anybody may contribute by simply submitting a GitHub pull request to the `gh-pages` branch on [github.com/satyanash/geekprotocol](https://github.com/satyanash/geekprotocol).

This is a very simple Jekyll website and modifications to the CSS, layout and posts are welcome. 

We try to document one situation per jekyll post so limit each PR per post.

You may submit multiple pull requests for different situations.
